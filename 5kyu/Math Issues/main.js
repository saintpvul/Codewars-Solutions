Oh no, our Math object was "accidently" reset. Can you re-implement some of those functions? We can assure, that only non-negative numbers are passed as arguments. So you don't have to consider things like undefined, null, NaN, negative numbers, strings and so on.

Here is a list of functions, we need:

Math.round()
Math.ceil()
Math.floor()
