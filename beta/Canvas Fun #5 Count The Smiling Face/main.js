Welcome to Canvas Fun ;-) In this series, we'll learning how to draw the image on a canvas.

Task
You are given a image.


Your task is to count the number of smiling face in the image.

No new canvas methods here. You just need some old methods from #4.

Note
The number of face is 1 to 10.

The size of face is randomly.

The faces will not cover each other

All faces are whole face, no half face appears.
