Convert text to brainfuck
You are tasked to writting a function to_brainfuck/toBrainfuck that converts a given string to brainfuck that would print the given string. For example if we were to call to_brainfuck("Hello World!") it might give us a result that is something like: "-[------->+<]>-.-[->+++++<]>++.+++++++..+++.[--->+<]>-----.---[->+++<]>.-[--->+<]>---.+++.------.--------.-[--->+<]>.", if we execute that code we would get "Hello World!" at the output.
