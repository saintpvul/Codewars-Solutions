/*

Create a function that returns the lowest product of 4 consecutive digits in a number given as a string.

This should only work if the number has 4 digits or more. If not, return "Number is too small".

Example
lowestProduct("123456789") --> 24 (1x2x3x4)
lowestProduct("35") --> "Number is too small"
