/*

Observe the process with the array given below and the tracking of the sums of each corresponding array.

[5, 3, 6, 10, 5, 2, 2, 1] (34) ----> [5, 3, 6, 10, 2, 1] ----> (27) ------> [10, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1]  ----> [4, 1, 2, 1, 1] (9) -----> [4, 1, 2] (7)
The tracked sums are : [34, 27, 9, 7]. We do not register one of the sums. It is not difficult to see why.

We need the function track_sum ( or trackSum ) that receives an array ( or list ) and outputs a tuple ( or array ) with the following results in the order given below:

array with the tracked sums obtained in the process
final array
So for our example given above, the result will be:

trackSum([5, 3, 6, 10, 5, 2, 2, 1]) == [[34, 27, 9, 7], [4, 1, 2]]
You will find more cases in the Example Tests.

Have a good time!
