/*

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

*/

// solution

const arrayDiff = (a, b) => a.filter((item) => !b.includes(item));

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    if (b.indexOf(a[i]) === -1) {
      result.push(a[i]);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
