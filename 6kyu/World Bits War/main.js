/*

Variation of this nice kata, the war has expanded and become dirtier and meaner; both even and odd numbers will fight with their pointy 1s. And negative integers are coming into play as well, with, Ã§a va sans dire, a negative contribution (think of them as spies or saboteurs).

A number's strength is determined by the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation. Negative integers work against their own side so their strength is negative. For example -5 = -101 has strength -2 and +5 = +101 has strength +2.

The side with the largest cumulated strength wins.

Again, three possible outcomes: odds win, evens win and tie.

Examples:

bitsWar([1,5,12]) => "odds win" //1+101 vs 1100, 3 vs 2
bitsWar([7,-3,20]) => "evens win" //111-11 vs 10100, 3-2 vs 2
bitsWar([7,-3,-2,6]) => "tie" //111-11 vs -1+110, 3-2 vs -1+2

*/

// solution

function bitsWar(numbers) {
    const odd = numbers
        .filter((v) => v % 2 !== 0)
        .map(
            (v) =>
                Math.abs(v).toString(2).replace(/0/g, "").length *
                (v < 0 ? -1 : 1)
        )
        .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    const even = numbers
        .filter((v) => v % 2 === 0)
        .map(
            (v) =>
                Math.abs(v).toString(2).replace(/0/g, "").length *
                (v < 0 ? -1 : 1)
        )
        .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    return odd > even ? "odds win" : odd === even ? "tie" : "evens win";
}
