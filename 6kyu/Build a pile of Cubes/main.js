/*

Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of 3**n, the cube above will have volume of (nâˆ’1)**3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1 ** 3.

You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n**3 + (n - 1)**3 + (n - 2)**3 + ... + 1 ** 3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

Examples:
findNb(1071225) --> 45

findNb(91716553919377) --> -1

*/

// solution

function findNb(m) {
  let cube = 0,
    n = 0;

  while (cube < m) {
    n += 1;
    cube += n ** 3;
  }
  return cube === m ? n : -1;
}
