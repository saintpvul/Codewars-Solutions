/*

Create a regular expression capable of evaluating binary strings (which consist of only 1's and 0's) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by 7.

Note:

Empty strings should be rejected.
Your solution should reject strings with any character other than 0 and 1.
No leading 0's will be tested unless the string exactly denotes 0.
