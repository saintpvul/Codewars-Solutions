Task
Coding in function topSecret, function accept 1 parameter:file. file is an encrypted string.

Encryption using the right shift 3. Your job is to decrypt the file and read the contents of the file, and then answer my three questions. If the answer is correct, you will pass the test. Note: the decryption should be left shift; Shift is only for uppercase and lowercase letters, other characters will remain the same; The shift mode is a cyclic shift, for example:

character "A" after decryption should be "X" instead of ">"
character "B" after decryption should be "Y" instead of "?"
character "C" after decryption should be "Z" instead of "@"
character "a" after decryption should be "x" instead of "^"
character "b" after decryption should be "y" instead of "_"
character "c" after decryption should be "z" instead of "`"
Additional hints: Fixed testcase only test the correctness of the decryption code. The answer to the three question will appear only after clicking on "Submit".

This task may be more difficult for beginners. Good Luck!

Some trainer may have doubts about the three questions, the following is some explanation, I hope to be helpful to the trainer.

for example, after you click "submit", you see these text on your screen:

Top secret files: No. 3330
Super agent eEB, on a dark night, stole the Apple core from National Museum, causing $100 million in damage.
and then:

question 1 should answer:"3330"
question 2 should answer:"eEB"
question 3 should answer:"Apple core"
if you haven't seen something like the text above, perhaps your decryption code is not correct ;-)

Although the text is not the same every time, the next time may appear:

Top secret files: No. 2135
Super agent ZIUScE, on a dark night, stole the Lolli pop from National Museum, causing $100 million in damage.
You only need to choose one of the text as the answer to the question. That is to say, any one of them is the correct answer.

// solution

const topSecret = (str) =>
  str.replace(/[a-z]/gi, (char) =>
    String.fromCharCode(char.charCodeAt() + (/[abc]/i.test(char) ? 23 : -3))
  );

console.log(topSecret("tommy has"));
