/*

In this kata, you'll be given an integer of range 0 <= x <= 99 and have to return that number spelt out in English. A few examples:

nameThatNumber(4)   // returns "four"
nameThatNumber(19)  // returns "nineteen"
nameThatNumber(99)  // returns "ninety nine"
Words should be separated by only spaces and not hyphens. No need to validate parameters, they will always be in the range [0, 99]. Make sure that the returned String has no leading of trailing spaces. Good luck!
