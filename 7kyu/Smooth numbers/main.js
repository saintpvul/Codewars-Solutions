The concept of "smooth number" is applied to all those numbers whose prime factors are lesser than or equal to 7: 60 is a smooth number (2 * 2 * 3 * 5), 111 is not (3 * 37).

More specifically, smooth numbers are classified by their highest prime factor and your are tasked with writing a isSmooth/is_smooth function that returns a string with this classification as it follows:

2-smooth numbers should be all defined as a "power of 2", as they are merely that;
3-smooth numbers are to return a result of "3-smooth";
5-smooth numbers will be labelled as "Hamming number"s (incidentally, you might appreciate this nice kata on them);
7-smooth numbers are classified as "humble number"s;
for all the other numbers, just return non-smooth.
Examples:

isSmooth(16) === "power of 2"
isSmooth(36) === "3-smooth"
isSmooth(60) === "Hamming number"
isSmooth(98) === "humble number"
isSmooth(111) === "non-smooth"
The provided input n is always going to be a positive number > 1.
