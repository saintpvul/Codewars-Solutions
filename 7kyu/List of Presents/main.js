Task:
Leo's girlfriend asked him to buy a gift list during his next trip, now he wants to know how many of them will he be able to buy.

Write a function to help Leo out. The first parameter of the function is Leo's budget; the second one is an array containing the price of each gift. You should return an integer representing the maximum amount of gifts Leo can buy.

Example:
Maximum budget: 20
Gift List: [13, 2, 4, 6, 1]
Should return 4.

_ NOTE: All numbers will be integers >= 0, and the array will never be empty. _
