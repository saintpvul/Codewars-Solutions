In this kata, your job is to create a class Dictionary which you can add words to and their entries. Example:

>>> let d = new Dictionary();

>>> d.newEntry("Apple", "A fruit that grows on trees");

>>> console.log(d.look("Apple"));
A fruit that grows on trees

>>> console.log(d.look("Banana"));
Can't find entry for Banana
Good luck and happy coding!
