/*

Punky loves wearing different colored socks, but Henry can't stand it.

Given an array of different colored socks, return a pair depending on who was picking them out.

Example:

getSocks('Punky', ['red','blue','blue','green']) -> ['red', 'blue']
Note that Punky can have any two colored socks, in any order, as long as they are different and both exist. Henry always picks a matching pair.

If there is no possible combination of socks, return an empty array.
