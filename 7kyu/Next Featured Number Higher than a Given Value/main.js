Make a function that receives a value, val and outputs the smallest higher number than the given value, and this number belong to a set of positive integers that have the following properties:

their digits occur only once

they are odd

they are multiple of three

nextNumb(12) == 15

nextNumb(13) == 15

nextNumb(99) == 105

nextNumb(999999) == 1023459

nextNumber(9999999999) == "There is no possible number that
fulfills those requirements"
Enjoy the kata!!
