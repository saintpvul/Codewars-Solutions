/*

Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

It is much easier to understand with an example:

* For seconds = 62, your function should return 
    "1 minute and 2 seconds"
* For seconds = 3662, your function should return
    "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"
For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.

Note that spaces are important.

// solution

function formatDuration(seconds) {
  var time = { year: 31536000, day: 86400, hour: 3600, minute: 60, second: 1 },
    res = [];

  if (seconds === 0) return "now";

  for (var key in time) {
    if (seconds >= time[key]) {
      var val = Math.floor(seconds / time[key]);
      res.push((val += val > 1 ? " " + key + "s" : " " + key));
      seconds = seconds % time[key];
    }
  }

  return res.length > 1
    ? res.join(", ").replace(/,([^,]*)$/, " and" + "$1")
    : res[0];
}
