/*

Our football team has finished the championship.

Our teams match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x us our teams score and y is our opponents score.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.
